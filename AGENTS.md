## Environments

JS/TS: `yarn`, not `npm`, unless project says otherwise. Python: `pip` + `venv`.

## Always Use Interactive Question Tools

Every user question → interactive tool, never plain text. Claude:
`AskUserQuestion`. Multiple questions: `grilling` skill.

## Task Tracking

When task list exists (multi-step work), use `TaskCreate`, `TaskGet`, `TaskList`, `TaskUpdate` to give user feedback. Mark tasks complete as done, don't batch.

## Code style

Standard conventions apply (SRP, early returns, no duplication, explicit
types). Repo-specific deviations only:

- Names: specific and unique. Avoid `data`, `handler`, `Manager`.
  Prefer names that return <5 grep hits in the codebase.
- Exception messages must include the offending value and expected shape.
  Why: past debugging sessions wasted time on bare `ValueError` with no
  context — see git history on `src/mcps/`.

## Comments

Keep own comments on refactor — they carry intent/provenance. Beyond that,
standard WHY-not-WHAT applies.

## Tests

- Tests run with a single command: `<project-specific>`.
- Mock external I/O (API, DB, filesystem) with named fake classes,
  not inline stubs.
  Why: inline stubs drift silently from the real interface; a named
  fake class fails loudly when the real dependency's contract changes.
